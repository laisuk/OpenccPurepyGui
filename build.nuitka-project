standalone = true

# Optional: bundle to a single EXE (slower startup); comment out if you prefer a folder

# Use Nuitkaâ€™s PySide6 integration (copies Qt plugins, handles PATH etc.)

# Include your local package explicitly (belt-and-suspenders even if it's importable)

# If your GUI package is a proper package, Nuitka will follow imports.
# If you keep loose scripts, add them with include-data-files or include-module.

# Include app data (adjust globs/paths to your project):
#   left side = on-disk pattern; right side = target folder inside dist

# (Optional) include license/readme
#include-data-files = LICENSE=LICENSE

# Reduce size (adds build time):

nofollow-imports = no
no-follow = tkinter  # example: exclude frameworks you don't use

# (Windows) use MSVC for best compatibility:
msvc = latest

# (Windows) set icon (ICO):
windows-icon-from-ico = resource/openccpurepygui.ico

# (macOS) app bundle basics:
#macos-app-icon = opencc.icns
#macos-app-name = OpenccPurepyGui
